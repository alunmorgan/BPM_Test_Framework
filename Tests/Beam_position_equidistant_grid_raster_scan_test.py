    The calc_x_pos and calc_y_pos functions are used to measure the theoretical beam position values.
    A set of ABCD values are created that will move the beam position from -5 to 5 in both the X and Y
    plane. This is then converted into attenuation values to put into the attenuator. A fixed RF frequency 
    and power is used while the attenuator values are changed. Finally the predicted values are compared 
    with the measured values of position.

            rf_frequency (float): Frequency output of the RF throughout the test, in MHz

                taking a reading from the BPM. 
            ReportObject (LaTeX Report Obj): Specific report that the test results will be recorded 
                to. If no report is sent to the test then it will just display the results in 
                a graph.
